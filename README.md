### CODSOFT Data Science Internship Projects

#### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Objective**: Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.
**Techniques**: Classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.

#### 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
**Objective**: Develop a regression model to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
**Techniques**: Regression techniques, data analysis, and feature engineering.

#### 3. Iris Flower Classification
**Objective**: Train a model to classify Iris flowers into species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
**Techniques**: Classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and feature extraction.

#### 4. Sales Prediction Using Python
**Objective**: Forecast future product sales using factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation.
**Techniques**: Regression techniques, data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

#### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective**: Build a model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
**Techniques**: Classification algorithms, data preprocessing, normalization, and handling class imbalance.

Each project involves using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and machine learning techniques to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance. The tasks will be documented in a GitHub repository and showcased in a video demonstration on LinkedIn.
